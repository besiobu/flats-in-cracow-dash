# [flats in cracow dash](https://flats-in-cracow.herokuapp.com/)

## Project goal
The goal of this project is to build a responsive web app to interact with models I [built](https://github.com/besiobu/flats-in-cracow) to predict flat prices in `Cracow, PL`.
The web app is hosted on heroku, [link](https://flats-in-cracow.herokuapp.com/).

## Project description
